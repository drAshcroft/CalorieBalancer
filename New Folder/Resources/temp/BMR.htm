<html><head>	<title>BMR/RMR Measure</title></head><body><h1>Base Metabolic Rate, Resting Metabolic Rate and Calorie Deficits</h1><font size=4><p>We base your daily calorie allotment around your RMR or BMR (these are similar but technically not the same. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"> Click for wiki on BMR</a>We have used the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to estimate this number.  </p><p>This may seem way to low for those who follow the metabolism crashing news.  Please remember that this is the resting metabolism rate, or the amount of calories that your body burns to survive, or in other words, the number of calories you would burn if you lazed flat on your back all day and all night long.</p><p>The program is set up so you enter your activities also into the database and your net calories are shown.  If you do not plan on using the activities calculator, increase this number by around 500 calories (which assumes that you walk around 5 miles in yourday to day activities)</p><p>Also keep in mind that this is just an estimate.  You would have to go to a lab to get this number tested.</p><p>As far as weight loss goes, you have to drop ~500 calories per day to lose 1 pound per week.  Research has shown that most people cannotlose more than 2 pounds per week.  So we subtract up to 1000 calories per day from your BMR to give you an estimate of what it will take to lose 2 pounds per week.  If the numbers seem off, please just adjust them to a better level manually.</p></body></html>
