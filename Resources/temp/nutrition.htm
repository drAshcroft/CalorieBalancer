<a name="Calorie"><h2>Calorie</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a 
kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius.&nbsp; Calories are units of energy and 
cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another (i.e. 
from fat to motion).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Carbs have 4 calories per gram</p>

<p>Protein has 4 calories per gram</p>

<p>Fat had 9 calories per gram.&nbsp; This is why your body stores excess energy 
in fat.</p>

<p>Your body is able to convert the energy from fat into protein and carbs, and 
visa versa.&nbsp; So it does not matter what form of calorie you ingest.&nbsp; 
There are some irregularities on the efficiency of absorption, but it is usually 
a small difference and so it is not wise to rely on this to lose weight.</p>

<a name="bmr"><h2>BMR</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The BMR is your bodies base metabolic rate.&nbsp; We have 
included two forms of metabolism into this number.&nbsp; The first is the 
classical BMR which is calculated by how much you weight, with a small 
modification due to the amount that is muscle.&nbsp; The second component is the 
number of calories burned that you do not account for in the activity journal.&nbsp; 
If you are good at recording your activities the number should agree well with 
the number that most calculators will give.&nbsp; This number determines the 
number of calories you need to eat to maintain your weight.</p>

<a name="fat"><h2>Fat</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fat is the bodies primary storage medium for calories.&nbsp; 
It consists of a chain of carbon atoms with an acid at the end.&nbsp; Fat has 
gotten a bad rap from well meaning nutritionist who were working with bad data.&nbsp; 
Fat also was a villain for the weight loss group as it has more calories per 
gram.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first thing you should know is that not all fat is bad 
for you, or your waistline.&nbsp; Fat makes food taste better, helps with hunger 
and serves essential functions in your body.&nbsp; Fat is essential for the 
absorption of&nbsp; vitamins A, D, E, and K, and carotenoids&nbsp; A moderate 
fat diet has been shown to be healthier for your heart than low fat diets.&nbsp; 
However, not all fat has been created equally.&nbsp; The reason there was 
confusion before was that experiments had not been done to measure the effect of 
the various types of fat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fat should be eating in moderation from sources that have 
not had fat added.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/fats.html">More 
information</a></p>

<a name="transfat"><p><b>Trans Fat</b></p></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trans fats are the baddest of the bad.&nbsp; They are made 
when oils are made into solid fats by an artificial process.&nbsp; They do occur 
naturally in animal tissues, but it is only a small amount.&nbsp; Trans fats 
have been shown to be bad for the heart, cause cholesterol problems, and even to 
cause weight gain on the same amount of calories as is maintained with other 
fats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you completely remove trans fats from your diet? No, 
as was said before, they do occur naturally, however you can avoid large doses 
of that fats.</p>

<p>Here are foods that contain large amounts of trans fats (they are now being 
listed on the labels)</p>

<p>Fast Foods, vegetable shortenings, some margarines, crackers, candies, 
cookies, snack foods, fried foods, baked goods, and other processed foods.</p>

<a name="saturatedfat"><p><b>Saturated Fat </b> </p></a>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Saturated fat is the evil cousin of the fat group.&nbsp; 
It is not as bad as Trans fat but is still hard on your heart.&nbsp; You should 
try to limit the amount of saturated fat you are getting.</p>

<p>These are sources of saturated fat.</p>

<ul minmax_bound="true">
  <li minmax_bound="true">High-fat dairy products such as full-fat cheese, 
  cream, ice cream, whole milk, 2% milk and sour cream. </li>

<a name="monounsaturatedfat"><p><b>Monounsaturated Fat</b></p></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monounsaturated fats are considered good fats.&nbsp; They 
provide protection for your heart.&nbsp; These are found primarily the plant 
sources and can be gained from </p>

</ul>

<p><br>
<a name="polyunsaturatedfat"><b>Polyunsaturated Fat</b></p></a>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Polyunsaturated fat is another form of good fats.&nbsp; 
It is more likely to become rancid, but it is better for people who have insulin 
resistance. Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats belong to this group and have shown great 
health benefits.</p>

<a name="cholesterol"><h2>Cholesterol</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cholesterol is generally though of as a bad nutrient that 
should be avoided for health.&nbsp; Your body is able to make its own.&nbsp; For 
more information here is an excellent article&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a name="sodium"><h2>Sodium</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sodium is half of the chemicals that make up salt.&nbsp; 
It is essential to the function of the body.&nbsp; It allows your body to get 
water into cells, keeps your body's pH correct and helps your nervous system.&nbsp; 
Too little sodium and you will die as sometimes happens to endurance athletes.&nbsp; 
Too much sodium and your body will experience high blood pressure, 
edema (swelling)) and other health conditions.&nbsp; Most Americans get twice the 
upper recommended limit of sodium.</p>

<a name="carbs"><h2>Total Carbohydrate</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carbohydrates are your bodies preferred source of energy.&nbsp; 
This is a group of nutrients that varies from fiber to sugar.&nbsp; Like fats, 
carbohydrates have gone through a image overhaul in the last few years.&nbsp; 
Years ago carbohydrates were the solution to everything, now a more complete 
picture is emerging that carbohydrates are dangerous and good for you like fats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A carbohydrate is made from sugar molecules.&nbsp; Sugars 
have only one unit while starches and fiber can have large numbers of sugar 
units strung together.&nbsp; In my research I work with sugars strung together 
by bacteria into molecular rings.&nbsp; Your digestive system treats all 
carbohydrates the same, it breaks them into sugar and then converts them to 
glucose.&nbsp; How quickly the body is able to break the carbohydrates down is 
its glycemic index.&nbsp; This is a measure of how much of a blood sugar spike 
you will get from a food.&nbsp; Foods that have a low glycemic index are the 
best to eat, while high glycemic indexes have been associated with obesity, 
diabetes, and heart disease.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to get as much of your carbs from whole grains, 
unprocessed foods and not &quot;white&quot;.&nbsp; These all have been shown to make 
dieting successful.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates.html">More 
information</a><br>

<a name="fiber"><b>Dietary Fiber</b></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiber is a carbohydrate that your body cannot digest.&nbsp; 
Fiber slows the digestive processes, giving foods a higher glycemic index.&nbsp; 
It also carries lots of healthful nutrients.&nbsp; It gives you a feeling of 
fullness, and is very important for digestive health.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Fiber Foods</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oatmeal, oat bran</li>
  <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
  <li>Dried peas, beans, lentils</li>
  <li>Apples, pears, strawberries, blueberries</li>
  <li>Whole grains,&nbsp; whole wheat breads,&nbsp; barley, couscous, brown 
  rice, bulgur</li>
  <li>Whole-grain breakfast cereals</li>
  <li>Wheat bran</li>
  <li>Seeds</li>
  <li>Carrots, cucumbers, zucchini, celery, tomatoes</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/fiber.html">More 
information</a></p>

<a name="sugar"><p><b>Sugars</b></p></a>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Sugars are the simplest of the carbs.&nbsp; They 
are rapidly absorbed and so have high glycemic indexes.&nbsp; However, they are 
not bad, only should be eaten in moderation for a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; Added 
sugars should be avoided, but naturally sweet foods are usually a great source 
of flavor in a diet.</p>

<a name="protein"><h2>Protein</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protein is the building block of life.&nbsp; It is build 
from  amino acids.&nbsp; Little is known about the amounts of protein needed 
for optimal health.&nbsp; There are two limits that are know.&nbsp; The human 
body needs around 9 grams of protein for every 20 pounds of body weight to keep 
tissue from starting to break down.&nbsp; At the upper limits, too much protein 
will leech calcium from bones leading to osteoporosis.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/protein.html">More 
information</a></p>

<a name="vitamina"><h2>Vitamin A</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitamin A is a major player in your health.&nbsp; It 
supports vision, bone growth, reproduction, cell division, cell differentiation,&nbsp; 
regulation of the immune system, which helps prevent or fight off infections.&nbsp; 
Vitamin A promotes healthy surface linings of the eyes and the respiratory, 
urinary, and intestinal tracts.</p>

<p>Vitamin A comes in many different forms, but the body absorbs animal sources 
most readily.&nbsp; Here are a list of sources of vitamin A.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Milk, margarine</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Beef liver</li>
  <li>Fortified breakfast cereals</li>
  <li>Carrots</li>
  <li>Cantaloupes</li>
  <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
  <li>Spinach</li>
</ul>

<a name="vitaminc"><h2>Vitamin C</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitamin C is a protective compound.&nbsp; It protects your 
body from the dangers of being alive in a toxic world.&nbsp; It also is one of 
the main components of collagen.&nbsp; Collagen is the main connective tissue of 
the body.&nbsp; Without collagen, your teeth fallout, muscles waste, wounds will 
not heal and scurvy develops.&nbsp; Sever vitamin C decency is rare, but the 
more vitamin C you get the better your health will be.&nbsp; Vitamin C is easily 
destroyed, so eat a little raw foods to maximize the benefit.</p>

<a name="calcium"><h2>Calcium</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calcium is the most abundant metal in our bodies.&nbsp; It 
is the key component of bones, and plays an important role in calming the 
nervous system.&nbsp; Although calcium is the most abundant mineral in our body, 
it is often inadequately supplied by our diets.</p>

<p><b>Foods that have calcium</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Tofu, almonds,&nbsp; peanuts, peas, black beans, and most soy drinks</li>
  <li>Dairy Products (Milk, cheese, yoghurt...)</li>
  <li>Broccoli, kale, spinach, tomatoes, Greens</li>
  <li>Wheat Flour, Cornmeal</li>
  <li>Sardines, Canned Salmon</li>

<a name="iron"><h2>Iron</h2></a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron is important for the energy of your body.&nbsp; It 
carries oxygen through the blood.&nbsp; It is especially important for women to 
get enough iron.&nbsp; To little iron and you will be anemic, which makes you 
tired and weak. The USDA says that over 3/4 of American women had iron intakes 
below 80 percent of their RDA</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron is lost under most cooking conditions.&nbsp; Cook 
your food for as little time as possible, with as little water as possible.&nbsp; 
Consider using cast iron cookware.</p>

<p><b>Foods that have iron</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beef, Liver, and Giblets, oysters</li>
  <li>Enriched whole wheat flour</li>
  <li>Enriched Rice</li>
  <li>Tomatoes, watermelon, raisins, and grapefruit, oranges, avocados, 
  strawberries</li>
  <li>Spinach, tofu, kidney beans</li>
  <li>Baking Chocolate</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee, tea, milk and EDTA (a chemical additive common in 
foods) all interfere with iron absorption, so avoid these foods when you are 
trying to get iron.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vitamin C promotes iron absorption, so get a drink of 
pulpy orange juice with your meal.</p>

<a name="magnesium"><h2>Magnesium</h2></a>

<p>The National Institute of Health estimates that at least half of America is 
not getting the required amount of magnesium needed by their bodies to perform
