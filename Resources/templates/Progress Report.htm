            <P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=4>&nbsp; Welcome to the 
            progress report.&nbsp; We will try to understand how your body 
            reacts to calories, nutrition and macronutrients.&nbsp; Everyones 
            body is different and ever diet effects people differently.&nbsp; We 
            have built this report as a tool to help you better understand 
            yourself and to be able to reach your goals.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, and most important 
            is not how much you weigh, but how much body fat you carrry.&nbsp; 
            Too much and you are fat, too little and your body will be sick, 
            lethagic and you mind will stop working.&nbsp; Like everything in 
            life you have to find your balance.&nbsp; Most health professionals 
            agree that around 20% body fat is the healthy medium.&nbsp; So this 
            graph shows how much body fat you have over time.&nbsp; When you 
            have hit the goal body fat percentage, the graph will show zero 
            pounds.&nbsp; You can go below zero, but it is actually worse for 
            your health to be underweight than overweight, so talk to your 
            doctor</FONT></P>

            want to know what your progress is on total weight. &nbsp; If your 
            total weight is increasing, but your excess body fat is decreasing 
            then you a doing well, as your metabolism is getting 
            stronger.</FONT> </TD></TR>
