<h1>Welcome to the most powerful calories counter available.</h1>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have worked hard to create a useable, fast and accurate program for
all your dietary needs. &nbsp; The program has three main areas to
help you succeed.<br>

<ul>

  <li><a href="quick_start.htm">Quick Start Help
Manual.</a><br>

  </li>

  <li><a href="how_to_lose_weight.htm">How To Lose
Weight</a><br>

  </li>

</ul>

<h2>The Meal Planner</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing is more helpful to succeeding than having your meals planned
and
expected.&nbsp; The meal planner allows
you preplan your meals, hit your calorie target, and eat what you like,
and only
what you like.&nbsp; Have no idea how to make a meal plan? You can
download plans from the website to improve your plans.

the meal planner?</a>

the meals?</a>

<h2>The Exercise Calorie Counter </h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nothing is better for your health and weight control than
exercise.&nbsp;
Exercise increases your metabolism, makes you feel good, lowers your
stress, controls you appetite, and makes you look good.&nbsp;
Proper eating is difficult to gauge when you are exercising, so we make
it easy.&nbsp; Just enter what exercise you want to do, how long
you worked
out and we will add those calories to the number you can eat in a
day.&nbsp;
Nothing is easier.

</ul>

<h2>Journal Entries</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do you eat for emotion? Are you losing weight? How is your diet
working?&nbsp;
All of these questions plague the dieter.&nbsp;
You can get help here.&nbsp; Put
your weight and your measurements into the program.&nbsp;
Record your emotions and better solutions in the journal and keep track
of the difficulty of the diet.&nbsp; All
of this information will be used to help you diet more effectively.

<h2>What is on the web?</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the long run, research has found that only two things are
important for a diet to succeed.&nbsp; First
and foremost the person has to continue on the diet, second, the person
needs
help from others.&nbsp; We have put
together a web site to help you continue, and get help from
others.&nbsp;
We have forums for you to discuss your troubles, get recipes and
insight
and download new plans.
