Exercise Tracker</font></SPAN></B></H1>
<P class=MsoNormal>The exercise tracker makes it possible to succeed in your 
workout program.&nbsp; Learn how many calories you are burning, how much more 
you get to eat when you exercise, and make sure that you are progressing as 
needed.&nbsp; The exercise tracker contains 400 activities that you will enjoy, 
so explore.&nbsp; </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</B><A

<P class=MsoNormal><IMG height=63 src="exerci23.jpg" width=63 ></P>
<P class=MsoNormal>Click on the exercise button to the left of the page.&nbsp; 
This will take you to the exercise tracker.&nbsp; As you look across the top of 
the page, you will see that a whole week is shown on this page.&nbsp; This 
allows you to quickly and easily plan out your workouts.&nbsp; To the left of 
the page you can enter the exercise names.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal>Click the space under <STRONG>Exercise.</STRONG>&nbsp; Type 
in “Walking”.&nbsp; You will see many choices, but chose “Walking(steps)”.&nbsp; 
‘steps’ refers to how any steps you have taken in that day(for those who like 
pedometers). &nbsp; If you do not count your steps, chose “Walking 
(Speed/Minutes)"&nbsp; This allows you to put your speed and time in to the 
program.&nbsp;&nbsp; The paranthesis tell you what the program is 
expecting.&nbsp; Most of the activities require the minutes you have 
exercised.&nbsp; This is shown in the picture above.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Next you must enter your 
numbers.&nbsp; Click on the appropriate day and row.&nbsp; In the first example, 
the number of steps has been entered. &nbsp; In the second, the speed&nbsp; in 
miles per hour and minutes have been entered.&nbsp; And last, the number of 
minutes were added
