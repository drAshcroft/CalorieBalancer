      the most slim and trim I've ever been. I went shopping for some new pants 
      for work, grabbed an 8, and they were too big. I slid right into a size 
      6.&nbsp;<BR><BR>It still slays me that I took all of these crazy pills, 
      went on all sorts of crazy diets, and did all of that nonsense for years 
      when I'm still finding it so easy. 1200-1300 calories a day and a minimum 
      of 45 minutes of moderate physical activity daily and this weight has just 
      melted off of me. It's awesome"&nbsp;Forum Poster.<BR></FONT></I><BR>&nbsp;<FONT size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp; I came across 
      this quote in a forum. People were talking about all the ways to lose 
      weight and this girl was the one that succeeded. You have probably tried 
      all kinds of silly, strange and most often expensive diets. You have 
      probably failed because the diets were so strange or expensive that you 
      could not maintain the diet. Here is the most condensed book you will ever 
      read on weight loss. You will be amazed how little you need to know to 
      succeed and feel better than you have ever felt about yourself.<br>

      <font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers have done
      remarkable experiments.&nbsp; They have taken people, put them in
      hospitals and then tracked every calorie that they eat.&nbsp; They put accelerometers
      in their underwear to record every calorie that they burn.&nbsp; What have
      researches found?&nbsp; It takes around 3500 calories under to lose a
      pound.&nbsp; It does not matter what the people ate. when they ate and how
      they ate.&nbsp; All that mattered was how much the people ate.</font>
      <p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No most of us cannot be
      hidden away in hospitals to lose weight, so what do you do.&nbsp; You probably
      have tried to eat less and exercise more and failed completely.&nbsp; This
      is the reason I built the Calorie Balance Program.&nbsp; My wife claimed
      she could not lose weight no matter what she did.&nbsp; She tried all the
      little diets she could find, and still did not lose weight.&nbsp; I built
      the program to allow her to lose weight, and figure out what she was doing
      wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;She has lost 40 pounds.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how it
      works.&nbsp; We recommend that you get a pedometer to record your
      movement.&nbsp; Enter your food into the program as you eat it or plan out
      your day with the meal planner.&nbsp; Enter your activity into the program
      to get the calories burned.&nbsp; When the calorie bar at the bottom of
      the page hits the other side of the indicator, you have gotten your
      calories.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; Exercise moves the bar down, eating
      moves it up.&nbsp; That is right you are rewarded for exercising.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try this simple program
      with the foods that you normally eat, or download a meal plan from the
      site to figure out new ways of eating.</font></p>

          simple graphical display of how much food you have eaten.&nbsp; When
          the <b>Calories</b> bar spans the too green vertical bars, you have
          reached your daily calorie count.&nbsp; The other bars help you to

        <li>Click on the cell under the desired day.
        <li>Enter the amounts, seperated by a slash.&nbsp; In this case the unit
          shows (sets/reps/weight/rest).&nbsp; This is a short way to record the
          number of weight lifting sets done.&nbsp; The number of reps in each
          set.&nbsp; The weight lifted and the rest between sets in
          seconds.&nbsp; So in the example above, this gives 3 sets each with 12
          lifts.&nbsp; 40 pounds were lifted and the lifter rested on 25 seconds
          before starting again.&nbsp; These complicated units are rare.<br>
