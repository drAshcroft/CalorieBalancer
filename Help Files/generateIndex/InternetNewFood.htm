<h2>Use the Internet to find new foods</h2>

<p>&nbsp;<font size="4"> There are times when
you cannot
find the desired food in
the database.&nbsp; You can use the internet to find a new
food.&nbsp; The
program has a built in utility to make adding new foods from the
internet
easier.&nbsp; To use this tool, either click <b>New Food</b>,&nbsp;and then the <b>Search Internet</b>
button.&nbsp; Or if you are searching for a
food in the calorie counter, select <b>Big Search</b>.&nbsp;
The internet food
dialog will appear.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;<img style="width: 704px; height: 394px;" src="Intern1.jpg" border="0"></font></p>

<p><font size="4">The dialog allows you to search
from any internet page in the
browser to the
left.&nbsp; You can enter the address of your favorite search
engine in the
address page.&nbsp; I have found that Yahoo gives very good results
with the
phrase, "Calories in XXX food"&nbsp; Where XXX is the desired
food.&nbsp;&nbsp; The program will constantly try to read the
webpages to find
the nutritional information.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><img style="width: 711px; height: 398px;" src="Intern2.jpg" border="0"></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><a name="InternetSearch"></a>Once
you have
found the desired nutritional
information webpage, shown here is the USDA page, the program will try
to read
the page to fill in the information.&nbsp; You will need to make
sure that the
information is correct, enter the foodname, and usually the serving
size.&nbsp;
If you do not know how many grams are in a serving, just guess or enter
100.&nbsp; Click <b>Save food</b> to finish.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">You can search the big database on
our website by clicking
Calorie Balance
Webpage at the top.&nbsp; This will operate the same way, only from
the our
database.&nbsp; Last you can look for a similar food from the
database and save
a new food by comparision.</font></p>
