<h2>The Calorie Counter</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research
has shown that the best way to lose weight is to keep a food
journal.&nbsp; We have made this
extremely easy.&nbsp; Just type in the
foods that you ate, how much you ate and the program will give you your
total
calories and a read out of your important nutrients.&nbsp;
You can weigh your servings if you want to, or use the handy units
already built in to the database.&nbsp; Not
only this, but the program will learn what foods you use and make it
easier for
you to find them as time goes on.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The calorie tracker makes it easy
to control your
weight. We have over 5000 foods from every category from fast food to
vegetables. Everything at your fingertips, in a quick and easy format.
The database also learns your preferences to make it easier to use all
the time.
